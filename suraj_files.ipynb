        "Ans:\n",
        "The primary difference between interpreted and compiled languages lies in how they are executed. Compiled languages are translated entirely into machine code by a compiler before the program runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, interpreted languages are executed line-by-line by an interpreter at runtime. This allows for easier debugging and greater flexibility but can lead to slower execution since each instruction is processed during execution.\n",

        "-----\n",
        "Q2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "Ans:\n",
        "Exception handling in Python is a mechanism used to gracefully manage errors that occur during the execution of a program. Instead of stopping the program when an error (or exception) happens, Python allows you to catch and handle the exception using specific syntax, which helps prevent crashes and improves user experience.\n",

        "Logging in Python is the process of recording messages that describe the execution of a program. It’s a powerful tool used to track events, errors, and system behavior during development, testing, and production. Python provides a built-in logging module to support flexible and configurable logging.\n",

        "Ans:\n",
        "The __del__ method in Python is known as a destructor. It is called automatically when an object is about to be destroyed, typically when there are no more references to it. It's used to perform clean-up tasks, such as releasing resources or closing files and connections.\n",

        "Ans:\n",
        "In Python exception handling, the try block contains the code that might raise an exception, allowing you to test risky operations safely. If an error occurs inside the try block, the normal flow of the program is interrupted, and Python looks for a matching except block to handle that specific exception.\n",

        "Ans:\n",
        "The else block in Python exception handling is used to execute code only if no exceptions occur in the preceding try block. It allows you to separate the code that should run when everything goes smoothly from the error-handling code. This helps keep the program logic clean by clearly distinguishing between normal execution and exception handling.\n",
